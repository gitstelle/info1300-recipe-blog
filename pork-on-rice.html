                RECIPE
            </h3>
            <h5>Servings: 4</h5>
            <h5>Prep Time: 20 min | Cook Time: 1 hr 40 min | Total Time: 2 hrs</h5>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb skin-on pork belly
                    (cut into 1/2” pieces)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons oil</li>
                <li>0.9 oz. rock sugar (or about 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar)</li>
                <li>1 small onion or a couple of shallots (diced)</li>
                <li>8 shiitake mushrooms (diced into 1/2” pieces)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup shaoxing wine</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>4 hardboiled eggs (peeled, optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (just enough so that the pork will be fully submerged), and
                    blanch the chopped pork belly for 1 minute. Drain, rinse clean of any scum, and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a wok over low heat, and add the sugar. Cook the sugar until it starts to melt and
                    then add the onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry the onions for a minute. Add the
                    mushrooms and stir-fry for another couple minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the blanched pork, shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce and water. Stir and bring the
                    mixture to a boil. Once boiling, add the spices (which should be tied in cheese cloth), along with
                    the peeled hardboiled eggs and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring
                    occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>At this point the meat should be fall-apart tender. To finish the dish, remove the spice packet and
                    turn up the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally. This process should
                    take about 5-minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, but there should still be
                    plenty of it left. Serve over steamed white rice.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I don’t think there’s any debate on this issue. Lu rou fan (滷肉饭) is one of THE most beloved Taiwanese
                comfort foods.</p>
            <p>There is, however, an on-going debate on whether this dish originated in Taiwan or Shandong, China.
                Apparently, 滷肉饭 and 鲁肉饭 are written differently, but both sound alike and the latter states the origin
                of Shandong in its name. To help set the record straight, the Taipei government actually launched a huge
                campaign in 2011, handing out 1000 bowls of lu rou fan and claiming ownership of the dish. That’s
                dedication, my friends. Can you imagine the U.S. government handing out a thousand apple pies or
                cheeseburgers, in the quest to put their political weight behind a food item?</p>
            <p>
                Just to be clear, I’m not about to open up any arguments here. Quarreling at the dinner table is bad for
                the digestion. I’m just happy that this dish has been passed down through so many generations and that
                we get to enjoy it today. I decided to post this recipe after watching a Taiwanese travel show that
                pretty much involved two guys crossing the country to try all the best local versions of lu rou fan they
                could find. As I watched them happily slurp up the rice and morsels of pork as one would a bowl of
                noodles, I decided it was time to make my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dish is a bit similar to the traditional Shanghainese dish, hong shao rou, or red cooked pork. While
                hong shao rou involves big, luscious chunks of pork
                belly, lu rou fan is almost like a braised meat sauce.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the old days, eating meat was often a luxury. How does one feed an entire family in the rare moment
                one has a small piece of pork to work with? You cut it into small pieces, braise it for a long time to
                create a savory braised meat sauce that’s bursting with flavor, and mix it with lots of steaming,
                comforting rice so the whole family can enjoy it. Genius.
