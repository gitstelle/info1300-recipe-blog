            <p>I used Chinese breakfast tea for my bubble tea recipe, but any other black tea or strong tasting green

                <li>whole milk to serve, or your choice of milk</li>
                <li>simple syrup to serve, or your choice of sweetener</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>For the simple syrup:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the tea: Steep the tea bags or leaves with 4 cups of freshly boiled water. Let the tea sit
                    in water until it cools completely.
                </li>
                <li>Prepare the simple syrup (if using): Add the water and sugar to a saucepan and quickly stir
                    everything
                    together. Heat the water on medium-high and cook until the water boils and the sugar completely
                    dissolves.
                    Remove the saucepan from heat and let the simple syrup cool before transferring to a jar.</li>
                <li>Cook the tapioca pearls: Bring about 4 cups of water to boil and add the tapioca pearls. Stir the
                    pearls and wait for them to float to the top. Then, cook them for another 5 minutes. Test a pearl to
                    see if it
                    has reached the desired level of softness. Cook the pearls for another few minutes if they are still
                    stiff. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pearls from the hot water. Quickly rinse the pearls with
                    water.
                    Transfer the pearls into a bowl, and mix the pearls with a few tablespoons of simple syrup (to
                    taste).</li>
                <li>Assemble the drinks: Strain the tea into a pitcher. Divide the cooked tapioca pearls into 4 large
                    glasses.
                    Next, add a few ice cubes to each glass. Pour 1 cup of the tea into each glass. Add 1 1/2
                    tablespoons of
                    milk and 1 1/2 tablespoons of simple syrup into each glass. Stir and taste the milk tea. Add more
                    milk or
                    simple syrup to your taste.</li>
                <li>If you are serving the beverage to guests, have a small pitcher of milk and the jar of simple syrup
                    ready so
                    that each guest can adjust their drinks to their taste. The drink is usually served with <a

                    use
                    spoons to scoop out the tapioca pearls.</li>

            <p>
                Bubble tea is one of my favorite things to sip on during the summer. Originating from Taiwan, bubble tea
                (波霸奶茶/珍珠奶茶) usually consists of sweetened tea with milk and the characteristic chewy tapioca balls, also
                known
                as boba (波霸). Bubble tea comes in many flavors: plain tea flavors such as black or jasmine tea; fruit
                flavors
                such as strawberry or honeydew; and even taro, which is a root vegetable commonly used in Asian dishes.
                (You can
                <a href="https://healthynibblesandbits.com/how-to-make-bubble-tea/" target="_blank">read more about the
                    history of bubble tea here).</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                While I enjoy drinking bubble tea, I don’t particularly like the ones sold in the teahouse chains
                because they
                contain too much sugar. The good thing is that you can make bubble tea at home easily! In this bubble
                tea
                recipe, all you really need is tea, tapioca pearls, milk, and a sweetener.
            </p>
            <h3>What kind of tea do you use?</h3>
            <p>
                The best kinds of tea to use are those that have a robust flavor, such as black or jasmine tea. Because
                you will
                water down the tea with milk and ice cubes, you want a strong tasting tea that will retain its flavor. I
                used
                <a href="https://shop.numitea.com/Chinese-Breakfast/p/NUMIS-10106&c=NumiTeaStore@Teabag@Black"
                    target="blank_">Numi’s Chinese Breakfast Tea</a> for the recipe, but any strong tea will work.
                Another tea blend I recommend
                is
                equal parts Assam and Ceylon tea leaves.
            </p>

            <h3>What kind of tapioca pearls do you use for your bubble tea recipe?</h3>
            <p>
                I typically use <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/WuFuYuan-Tapioca-Pearl-Black-Net/dp/B00PLTLG4O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1532018084&sr=1-4&keywords=tapioca+pearls&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=heanibbit-20&linkId=ff595b743c108350f907b1612aa37b4d"
                    target="_blank">this brand of tapioca pearls,</a> which cooks in about 5 minutes. I like that these
                pearls
                cook
                quickly, but the texture could be better. (For reference, slower cooking tapioca pearls can take up to
                an hour
                to cook.) You can find these tapioca pearls in Asian supermarkets or on Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>
                One important thing to note about these quick-cooking tapioca pearls is that you should <strong>only
                    cook as
                    many as you
                    need.</strong> The pearls stiffen as they cool, so they do not keep well overnight. However, if you
                leave
                the pearls in
                their cooking water, the pearls retain their soft texture for a longer time. In other words, don’t drain
                the hot
                water once you are done cooking the pearls. Instead, use a slotted spoon to remove the pearls from the
                saucepan,
                and leave any excess pearls in the saucepan.
            </p>
            <h3>What kind of milk can you use? Can this be dairy-free?</h3>
            <p>I prefer using whole milk the most because the rich flavor makes the beverage tastier overall. I tried a
                version
                of the bubble tea with heavy cream. While the flavor of the tea was even better than the version I made
                with
                whole milk, it felt too decadent. Perhaps using half-and-half is a good compromise?</p>
            <p>You can also make a dairy-free version with nut milks or soy milk. I tried using canned coconut milk
                once, and
                the coconut milk left a funny feeling in my mouth. It felt as if my mouth was coated with a thin layer
                of
                coconut fat.</p>

            <h3>What kind of sweetener do you use?</h3>
            <p>Any kind of sweetener works. However, if you use honey (or any thick syrup), it is best if you mix in the
                honey
                while the tea is hot so that the honey can dissolves evenly. The same goes for granulated sugar. Of
                course, this
                will mean that you’ll have to approximate how much sweetener you’ll need before the bubble tea is ready
                for
                tasting. You’ll probably need at least 2 tablespoons of honey for every 2 cups of tea.</p>

            <p>Because everyone has different preferences for sweetness, I recommend preparing simple syrup and having
                each
                person add however much simple syrup they want into their drinks. Simple syrup is easy to prepare.
                Combine 1/2
                cup of water and 1/2 cup of sugar in a saucepan and heat to a boil. Cook until the sugar dissolves and
                turn off
                the heat. Once the simple syrup has cooled, bottle it up, and it’s ready to be used. Typically, I use
                about 1
                1/2 tablespoons of simple syrup for each drink, just so it tastes barely sweet. Some people might want
                more
                syrup in their drink.</p>

            <h3>Can you make this recipe ahead?</h3>

            <p>You can steep the tea 1 or 2 days before and store it in the refrigerator. Also, you can make the simple
                syrup
                several days ahead. I wouldn’t recommend cooking the tapioca pearls more than an hour ahead because the
                pearls
                harden quite quickly.</p>
