        <h3>10 Essential Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            Whether folks out there are beginners in the kitchen or experienced home cooks looking to try their hand at
            Chinese cooking, the single most common question we get here on the blog concerns substitutions––mostly for
            the
            *seemingly* less common Chinese ingredients. </p>
        <p>
            What’s a substitute for Shaoxing wine? Will it taste the same without dark soy sauce?</p>
        <p><strong> The truth is, however, you don’t really need that many ingredients to cook with and enjoy authentic
                Chinese
                flavors. In fact, there are really just 10 essential Chinese pantry ingredients that are core to our
                arsenal.</strong></p>
        <p>Once you have these core Chinese pantry ingredients, you will be able to make 75% of the Asian recipes here
            on
            The Woks of Life!</p>

        <p>Whatever your skill level, read on if you want to learn how to cook Chinese food and start your Chinese
            pantry
            with these 10 items.</p>

        <p>Once you’ve got a solid foundation, you can add to your pantry, allowing you to make more authentic dishes!
        </p>
        <h4>1. Regular (or Light) Soy Sauce</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=light+soy+sauce&i=grocery&language=en_US&linkCode=sl2&linkId=bf910ee6e24a024443102568e2942795&tag=thwoofli08-20&ref=nb_sb_noss_2"
                target="_blank">Soy sauce</a> is the most iconic and well-known Chinese pantry essential that you likely
            already have stocked.
            So many Chinese dishes use this ingredient, and nowadays, many western chefs are adding soy sauce to their
            pantry arsenal to add extra umami to their dishes.
        </p>

        <p>While soy sauce is very commonly used as a table condiment by both Asians and Westerners, you might be
            surprised to learn there are differences in taste, saltiness and color among soy sauce brands and soy sauces
            from different countries including Thailand, Japan, and China. Like anything else, everyone has their
            favorite brands.</p>

        <p>The key to identifying a good soy sauce is making sure it is naturally brewed. Otherwise it may be a cheaper
            artificially-flavored or chemically formulated version. If you see a long list of chemicals and/or corn
            syrup and sweeteners as ingredients on the bottle, I recommend avoiding it!</p>

        <p>For those of you who are gluten free, don’t fret. A few companies have developed gluten-free soy products.
            In the past, the only alternative was Tamari, but there are more options available today.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Dark Soy Sauce</h4>
        <p>When it comes to stocking soy sauce for your basic Chinese pantry, both regular/light and dark soy sauces are
            a
            must.
            While you can get by with just regular or “light” soy sauce in some dishes, to get the right depth of
            flavor,
            color, and consistency for other dishes, <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dark+soy+sauce&i=grocery&language=en_US&linkCode=sl2&linkId=329f3cfc3284e258e9a3ff59e00bb03a&tag=thwoofli08-20&ref=nb_sb_noss_2"
                target="_blank"> dark soy sauce</a> is critical!
            There are some variations in dark soy sauce (e.g., mushroom flavored), and you’ll see some brands refer to
            dark
            soy sauce as “black soy sauce,” but they are all quite similar, with slight variations in flavor.</p>
        <h4>3. Sesame Oil</h4>
        <p><a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HMN6SC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002HMN6SC&linkCode=as2&tag=thwoofli08-20&linkId=V6S44WB7EQDR6CBM">Sesame
                oil</a> is one of the more recognizable flavors of Chinese and Asian cooking. Most of the sesame oils
            you see in markets are toasted, so they have a dark amber color and rich aroma. If you
            see a clear or yellow bottle of sesame oil, it is almost certainly not toasted and likely will not have as
            rich
            a fragrance and taste.</p>

        <p>Adding a little to stir-fry dishes helps give your dish that familiar Asian flavor. But remember you can
            really
            kill a dish by adding too much sesame oil. It can quickly become overpowering, so use sesame oil
            sparingly––just
            enough to complement your other ingredients and spices and sauces.</p>
        <h4>4. Shaoxing Wine</h4>
        <p> <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=shaoxing+wine&i=grocery&language=en_US&linkCode=sl2&linkId=8f6bd548312bc815db76899699ce434a&tag=thwoofli08-20&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">Shaoxing
                wine</a> is a type of rice wine from the Shaoxing region of China.

            In China and especially the Shaoxing region, this wine is sometimes consumed as a table wine. However,
            Shaoxing
            wine sold outside of China is usually brewed for cooking applications rather than consuming as a beverage.
        </p>
        <p>Some markets carry both brined and salt-free versions, so look for both! While there are many types of rice
            wine, the vast majority of our recipes (especially stir-fry dishes) call for Shaoxing wine. If you have a
            salt-restricted diet, you can reduce the amount of salt you add to your dish when using Shaoxing cooking
            wine.</p>

        <p>Check out a more complete description of different rice wines on our Chinese sauces page.</p>

        <p> For those of you who really cannot find Shaoxing wine, a good substitution is a dry sherry. Unfortunately,
            we
            haven’t come up with a good non-alcoholic substitute for Shaoxing wine yet, but since we have had many
            requests,
            we’re working on it!</p>
        <h4>5. Oyster Sauce</h4>
        <p> Whether you’re buying the traditional version made from oysters or the vegetarian version made from
            mushrooms,
            <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=oyster+sauce&i=grocery&language=en_US&linkCode=sl2&linkId=e42a9462d415d70bd81736e825341699&tag=thwoofli08-20&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">oyster
                sauce</a> provides umami flavor that really elevates the taste of any Chinese dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            My father was a career Chinese chef, and he always said, “If you want to make a dish taste better, just add
            oyster sauce.” So that should tell you something!</p>

        <p>For this reason, oyster sauce is a Chinese pantry essential even though it’s used mostly in Cantonese dishes.
            A
            good quality oyster sauce is expensive, but definitely worth the money, so go for quality when browsing the
            sauce aisle of your local Chinese market!</p>
        <h4>6. Cornstarch</h4>
        <p><a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cornstarch&i=grocery&language=en_US&linkCode=sl2&linkId=8435084ecae6efad15a6037a184ada95&tag=thwoofli08-20&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Cornstarch</a>
            (also called corn flour in some countries), is the most common thickening agent used in Chinese
            cooking. It is also the most readily available ingredient.</p>
        <p>
            Many of our recipes call for a 1:1 ratio of cornstarch and water mixed into a solution (or actually a
            colloid if
            you’re gonna be really scientific about it). We call this mixture a cornstarch slurry.</p>

        Cornstarch slurries help us thicken countless sauces in stir-fry dishes and braises. Larger batches are required
        for making Hot and Sour Soup or Egg Drop Soup. The top two tips for how to use cornstarch are:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix the cornstarch and water well right before you use it (it will separate within just a few minutes).
            </li>
            <li> Stir the sauce or soup quickly while drizzling in the cornstarch slurry, so lumps don’t form.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It’s that easy. Another common use for cornstarch is marinating meat. We use cornstarch to make the texture
            of
            meat silky and juicy.

            Cornstarch is also used for dredging and frying, yielding a perfectly light and crunchy texture. Some
            examples
            of this include our Mongolian Beef, Mongolian Chicken and Cantonese Salt and Pepper Pork Chops.

            Substitutions for cornstarch are tapioca starch and potato starch.
        </p>
        <h4>7. Ground White Pepper</h4>
        <p>
            <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=white+pepper&i=grocery&language=en_US&linkCode=sl2&linkId=5a808dade2d4f7bf7e26ce670fe5178c&tag=thwoofli08-20&ref=nb_sb_noss">
                White Pepper</a> is rarely used in Western cooking, but when it comes to Asian cooking, it’s
            used instead of
            black pepper.
        </p>

        <p>Freshly ground white pepper is always more fragrant than pre-ground white pepper, but pre-ground white
            pepper will do just fine in almost all cases. In certain applications, its powdery texture is preferred!</p>

        <p>White pepper has a steady burn that continues to the back of your throat.The heat is distinctly different
            from dried hot
            peppers or chilis.</p>
        <h4>8–10. Aromatics: Garlic, Ginger, Green Onion</h4>
        <p>Ginger, garlic, and scallions are the mirepoix, or holy trinity of Chinese cooking.</p>

        <p>Okay so maybe scallions aren’t *technically* a pantry item, but they’re so crucial and so easy to find that
            we’ve included them here.</p>

        <p>These aromatics are each essential to Chinese cooking, but not all dishes require all three. The flavors of
            ginger, garlic, and scallion vary depending on which you’re using and how you’re cooking them.</p>

        <h3>What Kitchen Tools Do You Need?</h3>
        <p>Of course, if you’re going to stock up on these pantry items, you’ll need the right tools to go alongside.
        </p>

        <p>Some other items you might be thinking about include a bamboo steamer or a metal steaming rack, and an
            automatic rice cooker. But can you learn how to cook Chinese food without all that stuff? You betcha. But
            these tools do make things easier.</p>
        <h4>A Wok</h4>
        <p>The most obvious tool you need is a good carbon steel wok and metal spatula. But if you don’t have a wok,
            that shouldn’t stop you! Simply use a large frying pan, and with our basic
            pantry ingredients, you can whip up most of our Chinese stir-fry recipes.</p>
        <h4>Steamer</h4>
        <p>For steaming, a bamboo steamer is great but not essential.

            You can also use an empty tuna can or evaporated milk can in a pinch if you need some height above the
            water. Simply put a heat-proof plate or rack on top of the can.</p>
        <h4>Rice Cooker</h4>
        <p>As for the automatic rice cooker, it’s a great tool to have on the counter if you’re making rice several
            times per week (we certainly do!)</p>
