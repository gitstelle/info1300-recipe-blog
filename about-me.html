            <p>My name is Estelle and I'm a Taiwanese-American college student at Cornell. I grew up eating my
                dad's delicious home-cooked meals. When I got to college, I realized how spoiled I was by his cooking
                and
                that I didn't know how
                to make any of my favorite comfort foods! I started this blog to document what I've learned so far and and what I
                will learn in the future!</p>
            <h2>Thanks for stopping by!</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions, try any of the recipes, or have recipes to share, please share let me know! I try
                to
